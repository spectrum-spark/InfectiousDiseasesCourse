Once a vector becomes infectious, they typically remain so for the rest of their life. They also are typically not adversely affected by the infection.\nExamples of vectors include (left to right) mosquitoes, ticks,\nblackflies and fleas:\n\n::: row\n<img src=\"mosquito.jpg\" alt=\"Mosquito biting\" style=\"width:25%\"/>\n<img src=\"tick.jpg\" alt=\"Tick\" style=\"width:25.6%\"/>\n<img src=\"Simulium_Blackfly.jpg\" alt=\"Blackfly\" style=\"width:21.4%\"/>\n<img src=\"flea.jpg\" alt=\"Flea\" style=\"width:12%\"/>\n:::\n\n### Examples of vector-borne diseases and vectors that spread them\n\nThere are many different types of vector. While some diseases, such as\nmalaria, are exclusively spread by a single vector genus, others, such\nas lymphatic filariasis, can be transmitted by multiple species.\nSimilarly, some vectors are able to spread multiple diseases.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Vector </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Disease </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Mosquito - Anopheles </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Malaria, Lymphatic filariasis </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Mosquito - Aedes </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Zika, Dengue, Lymphatic filariasis </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Mosquito - Culex </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> West Nile fever, Japanese encephalitis, Lymphatic filariasis </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Blackflies </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Onchocerciasis </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n<!-- todo: perhaps add some more non-mosquito examples relevant to Indonesia here -->\nSource:\n<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases\">\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases\n</a>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n**1.1 Do you know which of these vector-borne diseases is relevant to your region?

Female mosquitoes bite humans to obtain protein from blood\nfor their developing eggs. These bites can transmit infection from\nmosquito to human or from human to mosquito. The following diagram\noutlines a simple transmission cycle of a mosquito-borne disease:\n\n::: row\n<center><img src=\"vector_borne_cycle_simple.png\" alt=\"Simplified spread of a mosquito-borne disease\" style=\"width:50%\"/></center>\n:::\n\n<p><br></p>\n\nThe steps involved in transmission, as indicated on the diagram above\nare:\n\n1.  A susceptible mosquito bites an infectious human.\n2.  Infection is successfully transmitted to the mosquito. The pathogen\n    multiplies within the mosquito. The mosquito is now infectious, and\n    capable of transmitting disease.\n3.  The infectious mosquito bites a susceptible human.\n4.  Infection is successfully transmitted to the human. The pathogen\n    multiplies within the human. The human is now infectious, and\n    capable of transmitting disease.\n\nYou might notice that in our diagram above both humans and mosquitoes\nare infectious immediately upon being infected. In reality, it takes\ntime for the infectious load to build in a host before they are capable\nof transmitting infection. We make this assumption here to simplify the\nexplanation of the transmission process.\n\n### Recovery from infection\n\nFor the model that we are building in this session, we will assume that:\n\n-   Infectious humans recover at a rate that is the reciprocal of their\n    infectious period.\n-   Once an infectious human recovers, they are immune for the remainder\n    of their life.\n-   Mosquitoes, once infected, remain infectious for the rest of their\n    life.\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n**2.1 Based on the diagram and assumptions above, what compartments\nwould be required to model the human population?

Note only adult female mosquitoes bite. We start with the assumption that\neach mosquito makes a fixed number of bites per unit time, and we define\nthis as $b$. We further assume that those bites are uniformly spread\nacross the human population, $N_H$. It follows that the rate at which a\nspecific human is bitten by a specific mosquito, which we define as $r$,\ncan be calculated as:\n\n$$r=\\frac{b}{N_H}$$\n\nThis is the number of bites a single human receives from a single\nmosquito per unit time, and is analogous to 'contact' in\ndirectly-transmitted disease models.\n<!-- fixme: this contact rate has not yet been explained, so needs to be here. I.e. that transmision rate = contact rate times probability of infection given that contact occurs -->\n\n**2.3 What happens to the rate $r$ as the human population increases?\nWhat do you think might be the implication for transmission?**\n\n```{=html}\n<textarea cols=\"127\" rows=\"4\"></textarea>\n```\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n### Probability of successful transmission\n\nSimilar to contacts in the case of directly transmitted (human to human)\ninfections, not all mosquito bites will be of sufficient intensity to\ntransmit infection. For each bite, we assign a probability that the bite\nis of sufficient intensity to transmit infection (if one host is\nsusceptible and the other infectious), using the following notation:\n\n-   $T_{HM}$ is the probability that an infectious mosquito biting a\n    human transmits infection to the human\n-   $T_{MH}$ is the probability that an infectious human being bitten by\n    a susceptible mosquito transmits infection to the mosquito\n\nWe refer to this as the probability of successful transmission.\n\n**2.4 Write the expression for the number of bites a single human\nreceives from a single mosquito per unit time that are capable of\ntransmitting infection from mosquito to human.**\n\n<!-- todo: in the solutions, explain in words before writing down the equation -->\n\n```{=html}\n<textarea cols=\"127\" rows=\"2\"></textarea>\n```\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n**2.5 Write the expression for the number of bites a single human\nreceives from a single mosquito per unit time that are capable of\ntransmitting infection from human to mosquito.**\n\n```{=html}\n<textarea cols=\"127\" rows=\"2\"></textarea>\n```\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n### Force of infection on humans $(λ_H)$ and on mosquitoes $(λ_M)$\n\nThe expressions in 2.4 and 2.5 are for the rate of 'successful' bites\nbetween a single susceptible human and a single infectious mosquito. The\n*force of infection on humans*, $λ_H$, is the rate at which a\nsusceptible human acquires infection, noting that infection can be\nacquired from any infectious mosquito.\n\n**2.6 Write the expression for the force of infection on humans,**\n$λ_H$.\n\n```{=html}\n<textarea cols=\"127\" rows=\"2\"></textarea>\n```\n\n<p><br></p>\n\nSimilarly the *force of infection on mosquitoes*, $λ_M$, is the rate at\nwhich a susceptible mosquito acquires infection. A mosquito can acquire\ninfection from any infectious human.\n\n**2.7 Write the expression for the force of infection on mosquitoes,**\n$λ_M$.\n\n```{=html}\n<textarea cols=\"127\" rows=\"2\"></textarea>\n```\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n### New infections per unit time\n\nThe force of infection (on humans or mosquitoes) is the rate at which\ninfection is acquired in a single susceptible host. To calculate the\nrate that new infections occur in the whole human or mosquito\npopulation, we have to multiply the force of infection by the population\nat risk of being infected.\n\n**2.8 Using the equation for the force of infection on humans, $λ_H$,\nwrite the expression for the total number of human infections per unit\ntime.**\n\n```{=html}\n<textarea cols=\"127\" rows=\"2\"></textarea>\n```\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n**2.9 Using the equation for the force of infection on mosquitoes,\n$λ_M$, write the expression for the total number of mosquito infections\nper unit time.**\n\n```{=html}\n<textarea cols=\"127\" rows=\"2\"></textarea>\n```\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n### Births and deaths\n\n-   Typically the demographic processes of mosquitoes (births, deaths)\n    occur on a much shorter time scale than the same processes for\n    humans --- mosquitoes may live a few weeks whereas humans live for\n    decades.\n-   Depending on the time over which the model will be run to answer the\n    research question, it is common for mosquito births and deaths to be\n    included in a model while human births and deaths are omitted.\n-   To maintain a constant population in a model, we set the birth rates\n    and the death rates to be equal.\n-   In the model we are building in this session, we will ignore human\n    births and deaths and maintain a constant mosquito population.\n-   In the model we are building in this session, all new members of the\n    population are born susceptible to the modelled disease.\n\n### Other modelling considerations\n\n-   Many of the processes affecting the life cycle of mosquitoes are\n    highly climate dependent and so vary seasonally. For the purposes of\n    illustration, we will not include seasonality in our model.\n  <!-- todo: if remove oncho above, need to update this point too -->\n-   As we saw when we compared the transmission cycle for onchocerciasis\n    with the transmission cycle of West Nile virus, for some\n    vector-borne diseases vertebrate hosts other than humans are\n    involved. As this adds substantial complexity to the model, in this\n    session we consider only diseases that spread human-vector-human.\n-   While we have assumed a constant probability across the whole\n    population that a bite will result in transmission, in reality this\n    may not be the case due to population heterogeneity. \n- If a disease is transmitted by multiple mosquito species, the lifespans and other important factors may be different, so may need to be explicitly modelled.\n\n<p><input type=\"button\" value=\"Print this page\" onClick=\"window.print()\"></p>\n\n## **Part 2:** Solutions\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n## **Part 2:** Spoiler alert\n\nThe solutions tab contains solutions for Part 2. **Only click on it if\nyou have tried to complete the exercises yourself and need some help**\n\n## **Part 2:** Solutions for Part 2\n\n### Purpose\n\nIn this part of the session, we will consider the mechanistic process by\nwhich vector-borne diseases spread and consider the other elements that\nare needed in vector-borne disease models.\n\n### Simplified spread of a mosquito-borne disease\n\nWhile there are many different types of vectors, in this and the\nfollowing part we will cover modelling of diseases that are spread by\nmosquitoes.

The\n*force of infection on humans*, $λ_H$, is the rate at which a\nsusceptible human acquires infection, noting that infection can be\nacquired from any infectious mosquito.\n\n**2.6 Write the expression for the force of infection on humans,\n$\\lambda_H$.**\n\n[$T_{HM} \\times \\frac{b}{N_H} \\times I_M$]{style=\"color: blue\"}\n\n<p><br></p>\n\nSimilarly the *force of infection on mosquitoes*, $λ_M$, is the rate at\nwhich a susceptible mosquito acquires infection. A mosquito can acquire\ninfection from any infectious human.\n\n**2.7 Write the expression for the force of infection on mosquitoes,\n$λ_M$.**\n\n[$T_{MH} \\times \\frac{b}{N_H} \\times I_H$]{style=\"color: blue\"}\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n### New infections per unit time\n\nThe force of infection (on humans or mosquitoes) is the rate at which\ninfection is acquired in a single susceptible host. To calculate the\nrate that new infections occur in the whole human or mosquito\npopulation, we have to multiply the force of infection by the population\nat risk of being infected.\n\n**2.8 Using the equation for the force of infection on humans, $λ_H$,\nwrite the expression for the total number of human infections per unit\ntime.**\n\n[$T_{HM} \\times \\frac{b}{N_H} \\times I_M \\times S_H$]{style=\"color: blue\"}\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n**2.9 Using the equation for the force of infection on mosquitoes,\n$λ_M$, write the expression for the total number of mosquito infections\nper unit time.**\n\n[$T_{MH} \\times \\frac{b}{N_H} \\times I_H \\times S_M$]{style=\"color: blue\"}\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n### Births and deaths\n\n-   Typically the demographic processes of mosquitoes (births, deaths)\n    occur on a much shorter time scale than the same processes for\n    humans --- mosquitoes may live a few weeks whereas humans live for\n    decades.\n-   Depending on the time over which the model will be run to answer the\n    research question, it is common for mosquito births and deaths to be\n    included in a model while human births and deaths are omitted.\n-   To maintain a constant population in a model, we set the birth rates\n    and the death rates to be equal.\n-   In the model we are building in this session, we will ignore human\n    births and deaths and maintain a constant mosquito population.\n-   In the model we are building in this session, all new members of the\n    population are born susceptible to the modelled disease.\n\n### Other modelling considerations\n\n-   Many of the processes affecting the life cycle of mosquitoes are\n    highly climate dependent and so vary seasonally. For the purposes of\n    illustration, we will not include seasonality in our model.\n-   As we saw when we compared the transmission cycle for onchocerciasis\n    with the transmission cycle of West Nile virus, for some\n    vector-borne diseases vertebrate hosts other than humans are\n    involved. As this adds substantial complexity to the model, in this\n    session we consider only diseases that spread human-vector-human.\n-   While we have assumed a constant probability across the whole\n    population that a bite will result in transmission, in reality this\n    may not be the case due to population heterogeneity. Comparing the\n    force of infection measured in humans to the measured entomological\n    inoculation rate (EIR), which is the average number of infectious\n    bites per human per unit time, can help calibrate models to real\n    data.\n\n<p><input type=\"button\" value=\"Print this page\" onClick=\"window.print()\"></p>\n:::\n\n## **Part 3:** Writing the model\n\n### Model Diagram\n\nNow that we have explored how the human and mosquito populations\ninteract in a vector-borne disease model and made some assumptions\naround what to include in our first model, we will design an appropriate\nmodel structure.
