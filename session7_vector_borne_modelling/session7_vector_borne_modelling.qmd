# Summary {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

This is an interactive session to introduce the concepts of modelling
vector-borne diseases. The motivation for modelling and differences
compared to modelling diseases spread by direct transmission will be
covered. We will write down a basic model and derive the expression for
$\mathcal{R}_0$.

This session is divided into three parts:

**Part 1** covers:

-   Motivation for vector-borne disease models
-   Examples of vector-borne diseases
-   Different transmission cycles

**Part 2** covers:

-   The mechanics of vector-borne disease transmission
-   Force of infection for vector-borne diseases
-   Other vector-borne disease modelling considerations

**Part 3** covers:

-   Drawing a model schematic
-   Writing the differential equations
-   Calculating the basic reproduction number

*We recommend saving your text at the end of each part by printing the
file.*

## **Part 1:** Motivation and examples

### What are vector-borne diseases?

Unlike diseases that spread directly from person to person, vector-borne
diseases are those diseases in which the spread of an infectious
pathogen occurs via a vector --- a living organism that is typically a bloodsucking insect, such as a mosquito. Once a vector becomes infectious, they typically remain so for the rest of their life. They also are typically not adversely affected by the infection.
Examples of vectors include (left to right) mosquitoes, ticks,
blackflies and fleas:

<img src="flea.jpg" alt="Flea" style="width:12%"/>

### Examples of vector-borne diseases and vectors that spread them

There are many different types of vector. While some diseases, such as
malaria, are exclusively spread by a single vector genus, others, such
as lymphatic filariasis, can be transmitted by multiple species.
Similarly, some vectors are able to spread multiple diseases.

```{r echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(
  Vector = c("Mosquito - Anopheles", "Mosquito - Aedes", "Mosquito - Culex", "Blackflies", "Flea", "Tick"),
  Disease = c("Malaria, Lymphatic filariasis", "Zika, Dengue, Lymphatic filariasis", "West Nile fever, Japanese encephalitis, Lymphatic filariasis", "Onchocerciasis", "Murine typhus, plague", "Lyme disease, tick-borne meningoencephalitis")
)

We can divide vector-borne diseases into two categories, those that
spread by a human-vector-human cycle (e.g. malaria, dengue, zika) 
and those that involve a non-human host (e.g. West Nile
virus, Japanese encephalitis). In this session, we will only be working
with diseases that spread by a human-vector-human cycle.

### Burden of disease

Diseases spread by vectors account for almost one-fifth of all
infectious diseases and are responsible for more than 700,000 deaths
annually. Much of this disease burden is due to malaria and dengue
infections, estimated to cause more than 440,000 deaths per year. The
map below displays the distribution of deaths due to vector-borne
diseases, estimated by the World Health Organization in 2002. While
Africa has the highest burden, there is substantial burden in the Asia
Pacific region. As global temperatures increase, the global distribution
of vectors is changing, which may allow the spread of vector-borne
diseases into new areas.

We can divide vector-borne diseases into two categories, those that
spread by a human-vector-human cycle (e.g. malaria, dengue, zika,
onchocerciasis) and those that involve a non-human host (e.g. West Nile
virus, Japanese encephalitis). In this session, we will only be working

## **Part 2:** Elements of vector-borne disease models

### Purpose

In this part of the session, we will consider the mechanistic process by
which vector-borne diseases spread and consider the other elements that
are needed in vector-borne disease models.

### Simplified spread of a mosquito-borne disease
<!-- todo: consider changing "vector" to "mosquito" throughout this section and the next for consistency -->
While there are many different types of vectors, in this and the
following part we will cover modelling of diseases that are spread by
mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes bite humans to obtain protein from blood
for their developing eggs. These bites can transmit infection from
mosquito to human or from human to mosquito. The following diagram
outlines a simple transmission cycle of a mosquito-borne disease:

::: row
<center><img src="vector_borne_cycle_simple.png" alt="Simplified spread of a mosquito-borne disease" style="width:50%"/></center>
:::

<p><br></p>

The steps involved in transmission, as indicated on the diagram above
are:

1.  A susceptible mosquito bites an infectious human.
2.  Infection is successfully transmitted to the mosquito. The pathogen
    multiplies within the mosquito. The mosquito is now infectious, and
    capable of transmitting disease.
3.  The infectious mosquito bites a susceptible human.
4.  Infection is successfully transmitted to the human. The pathogen
    multiplies within the human. The human is now infectious, and
    capable of transmitting disease.

You might notice that in our diagram above both humans and mosquitoes
are infectious immediately upon being infected. In reality, it takes
time for the infectious load to build in a host before they are capable
of transmitting infection. We make this assumption here to simplify the
explanation of the transmission process.

### Recovery from infection

For the model that we are building in this session, we will assume that:

-   Infectious humans recover at a rate that is the reciprocal of their
    infectious period.
-   Once an infectious human recovers, they are immune for the remainder
    of their life.
-   Mosquitoes, once infected, remain infectious for the rest of their
    life.

would be required to model the mosquito population? Use the subscript M
to indicate that these are mosquito compartments.**

```{=html}
<textarea cols="127" rows="4"></textarea>
```

<p><br></p>

### Human and mosquito populations interact through [bites]{style="color: red"}

The feature that makes vector-borne disease models different to models
for diseases spread by direct contact is that the human and mosquito
populations interact through bites. Note only adult female mosquitoes bite. We start with the assumption that
each mosquito makes a fixed number of bites per unit time, and we define
this as $b$. We further assume that those bites are uniformly spread
across the human population, $N_H$. It follows that the rate at which a
specific human is bitten by a specific mosquito, which we define as $r$,
can be calculated as:

$$r=\frac{b}{N_H}$$

This is the number of bites a single human receives from a single
mosquito per unit time, and is analogous to 'contact' in
directly-transmitted disease models.
<!-- fixme: this contact rate has not yet been explained, so needs to be here. I.e. that transmision rate = contact rate times probability of infection given that contact occurs -->

**2.3 What happens to the rate $r$ as the human population increases?
What do you think might be the implication for transmission?**

```{=html}
<textarea cols="127" rows="4"></textarea>
```

<p><br></p>

### Probability of successful transmission

Similar to contacts in the case of directly transmitted (human to human)
infections, not all mosquito bites will be of sufficient intensity to
transmit infection. For each bite, we assign a probability that the bite
is of sufficient intensity to transmit infection (if one host is
susceptible and the other infectious), using the following notation:

-   $T_{HM}$ is the probability that an infectious mosquito biting a
    human transmits infection to the human
-   $T_{MH}$ is the probability that an infectious human being bitten by
    a susceptible mosquito transmits infection to the mosquito

We refer to this as the probability of successful transmission.

**2.4 Write the expression for the number of bites a single human
receives from a single mosquito per unit time that are capable of
transmitting infection from mosquito to human.**

<!-- todo: in the solutions, explain in words before writing down the equation -->

```{=html}
<textarea cols="127" rows="2"></textarea>

**2.5 Write the expression for the number of bites a single human
receives from a single mosquito per unit time that are capable of
transmitting infection from human to mosquito.**

```{=html}
<textarea cols="127" rows="2"></textarea>
```

<p><br></p>

### Force of infection on humans $(λ_H)$ and on mosquitoes $(λ_M)$

The expressions in 2.4 and 2.5 are for the rate of 'successful' bites
between a single susceptible human and a single infectious mosquito. The
*force of infection on humans*, $λ_H$, is the rate at which a
susceptible human acquires infection, noting that infection can be
acquired from any infectious mosquito.

**2.6 Write the expression for the force of infection on humans,**
$λ_H$.

```{=html}
<textarea cols="127" rows="2"></textarea>
```

<p><br></p>

Similarly the *force of infection on mosquitoes*, $λ_M$, is the rate at
which a susceptible mosquito acquires infection. A mosquito can acquire
infection from any infectious human.

**2.7 Write the expression for the force of infection on mosquitoes,**
$λ_M$.

```{=html}
<textarea cols="127" rows="2"></textarea>
```

<p><br></p>

### New infections per unit time

The force of infection (on humans or mosquitoes) is the rate at which
infection is acquired in a single susceptible host. To calculate the
rate that new infections occur in the whole human or mosquito
population, we have to multiply the force of infection by the population
at risk of being infected.

**2.8 Using the equation for the force of infection on humans, $λ_H$,
write the expression for the total number of human infections per unit
time.**

```{=html}
<textarea cols="127" rows="2"></textarea>
```

<p><br></p>

**2.9 Using the equation for the force of infection on mosquitoes,
$λ_M$, write the expression for the total number of mosquito infections
per unit time.**

```{=html}
<textarea cols="127" rows="2"></textarea>
```

<p><br></p>

### Births and deaths

-   Typically the demographic processes of mosquitoes (births, deaths)
    occur on a much shorter time scale than the same processes for
    humans --- mosquitoes may live a few weeks whereas humans live for
    decades.
-   Depending on the time over which the model will be run to answer the
    research question, it is common for mosquito births and deaths to be
    included in a model while human births and deaths are omitted.
-   To maintain a constant population in a model, we set the birth rates
    and the death rates to be equal.
-   In the model we are building in this session, we will ignore human
    births and deaths and maintain a constant mosquito population.
-   In the model we are building in this session, all new members of the
    population are born susceptible to the modelled disease.

### Other modelling considerations

-   Many of the processes affecting the life cycle of mosquitoes are
    highly climate dependent and so vary seasonally. For the purposes of
    illustration, we will not include seasonality in our model.
  <!-- todo: if remove oncho above, need to update this point too -->
-   As we saw when we compared the transmission cycle for dengue
    with the transmission cycle of Japanese encephalitis virus, for some
    vector-borne diseases vertebrate hosts other than humans are
    involved. As this adds substantial complexity to the model, in this
    session we consider only diseases that spread human-vector-human.
-   While we have assumed a constant probability across the whole
    population that a bite will result in transmission, in reality this
    may not be the case due to population heterogeneity. 
- If a disease is transmitted by multiple mosquito species, the lifespans and other important factors may be different, so may need to be explicitly modelled.

### Purpose

In this part of the session, we will consider the mechanistic process by
which vector-borne diseases spread and consider the other elements that
are needed in vector-borne disease models.

### Simplified spread of a mosquito-borne disease

While there are many different types of vectors, in this and the
following part we will cover modelling of diseases that are spread by
mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes bite humans to obtain protein from blood
for their developing eggs. These bites can transmit infection from
mosquito to human or from human to mosquito. The following diagram
outlines a simple transmission cycle of a mosquito-borne disease:

::: row
<center><img src="vector_borne_cycle_simple.png" alt="Simplified spread of a mosquito-borne disease" style="width:50%"/></center>
:::

<p><br></p>

The steps involved in transmission, as indicated on the diagram above
are:

1.  A susceptible mosquito bites an infectious human.
2.  Infection is successfully transmitted to the mosquito. The pathogen
    multiplies within the mosquito. The mosquito is now infectious, and
    capable of transmitting disease.
3.  The infectious mosquito bites a susceptible human.
4.  Infection is successfully transmitted to the human. The pathogen
    multiplies within the human. The human is now infectious, and
    capable of transmitting disease.

You might notice that in our diagram above both humans and mosquitoes
are infectious immediately upon being infected. In reality, it takes
time for the infectious load to build in a host before they are capable
of transmitting infection. We make this assumption here to simplify the
explanation of the transmission process.

### Recovery from infection

For the model that we are building in this session, we will assume that:

-   Infectious humans recover at a rate that is the reciprocal of their
    infectious period.
-   Once an infectious human recovers, they are immune for the remainder
    of their life.
-   Mosquitoes, once infected, remain infectious for the rest of their
    life.

[$S_M, I_M$]{style="color: blue"}

<p><br></p>

### Human and mosquito populations interact through [bites]{style="color: red"}

The feature that makes vector-borne disease models different to models
for diseases spread by direct contact is that the human and mosquito
populations interact through bites. We start with the assumption that
each mosquito makes a fixed number of bites per unit time, and we define
this as $b$. We further assume that those bites are uniformly spread
across the human population, $N_H$. It follows that the rate at which a
specific human is bitten by a specific mosquito, which we define as $r$,
can be calculated as:

$$r=\frac{b}{N_H}$$

This is the number of bites a single human receives from a single
mosquito per unit time, and is analogous to 'contact' in
directly-transmitted disease models.

**2.3 What happens to the rate $r$ as the human population increases?
What do you think might be the implication for transmission?**

[It reduces as the same number of bites are spread over more people.
This makes it less likely that a human will be bitten the two times
necessary in the required timeframe in order to continue transmission
(i.e. once to be infected by an infectious mosquito and then by a
susceptible mosquito to infect them.]{style="color: blue"}

<p><br></p>

### Probability of successful transmission

Similar to contacts in the case of directly transmitted (human to human)
infections, not all mosquito bites will be of sufficient intensity to
transmit infection. For each bite, we assign a probability that the bite
is of sufficient intensity to transmit infection (if one host is
susceptible and the other infectious), using the following notation:

-   $T_{HM}$ is the probability that an infectious mosquito biting a
    human transmits infection to the human
-   $T_{MH}$ is the probability that an infectious human being bitten by
    a susceptible mosquito transmits infection to the mosquito

We refer to this as the probability of successful transmission.

**2.4 Write the expression for the number of bites a single human
receives from a single mosquito per unit time that are capable of
transmitting infection from mosquito to human.**

[$T_{HM} \times \frac{b}{N_H}$]{style="color: blue"}

<p><br></p>

**2.5 Write the expression for the number of bites a single human
receives from a single mosquito per unit time that are capable of
transmitting infection from human to mosquito.**

[$T_{MH} \times \frac{b}{N_H}$]{style="color: blue"}

<p><br></p>

### Force of infection on humans $(λ_H)$ and on mosquitoes $(λ_M)$

The expressions in 2.4 and 2.5 are for the rate of 'successful' bites
between a single susceptible human and a single infectious mosquito. The
*force of infection on humans*, $λ_H$, is the rate at which a
susceptible human acquires infection, noting that infection can be
acquired from any infectious mosquito.

**2.6 Write the expression for the force of infection on humans,
$\lambda_H$.**

[$T_{HM} \times \frac{b}{N_H} \times I_M$]{style="color: blue"}

<p><br></p>

Similarly the *force of infection on mosquitoes*, $λ_M$, is the rate at
which a susceptible mosquito acquires infection. A mosquito can acquire
infection from any infectious human.

**2.7 Write the expression for the force of infection on mosquitoes,
$λ_M$.**

[$T_{MH} \times \frac{b}{N_H} \times I_H$]{style="color: blue"}

<p><br></p>

### New infections per unit time

The force of infection (on humans or mosquitoes) is the rate at which
infection is acquired in a single susceptible host. To calculate the
rate that new infections occur in the whole human or mosquito
population, we have to multiply the force of infection by the population
at risk of being infected.

**2.8 Using the equation for the force of infection on humans, $λ_H$,
write the expression for the total number of human infections per unit
time.**

[$T_{HM} \times \frac{b}{N_H} \times I_M \times S_H$]{style="color: blue"}

<p><br></p>

**2.9 Using the equation for the force of infection on mosquitoes,
$λ_M$, write the expression for the total number of mosquito infections
per unit time.**

[$T_{MH} \times \frac{b}{N_H} \times I_H \times S_M$]{style="color: blue"}

<p><br></p>

### Births and deaths

-   Typically the demographic processes of mosquitoes (births, deaths)
    occur on a much shorter time scale than the same processes for
    humans --- mosquitoes may live a few weeks whereas humans live for
    decades.
-   Depending on the time over which the model will be run to answer the
    research question, it is common for mosquito births and deaths to be
    included in a model while human births and deaths are omitted.
-   To maintain a constant population in a model, we set the birth rates
    and the death rates to be equal.
-   In the model we are building in this session, we will ignore human
    births and deaths and maintain a constant mosquito population.
-   In the model we are building in this session, all new members of the
    population are born susceptible to the modelled disease.

### Other modelling considerations

-   Many of the processes affecting the life cycle of mosquitoes are
    highly climate dependent and so vary seasonally. For the purposes of
    illustration, we will not include seasonality in our model.
-   As we saw when we compared the transmission cycle for dengue
    with the transmission cycle of Japanese encephalitis, for some
    vector-borne diseases vertebrate hosts other than humans are
    involved. As this adds substantial complexity to the model, in this
    session we consider only diseases that spread human-vector-human.
-   While we have assumed a constant probability across the whole
    population that a bite will result in transmission, in reality this
    may not be the case due to population heterogeneity. Comparing the

## **Part 3:** Writing the model

### Model Diagram

Now that we have explored how the human and mosquito populations
interact in a vector-borne disease model and made some assumptions
around what to include in our first model, we will design an appropriate
model structure. Using the model compartments you identified in Part 2,
and the inflows and outflows from each compartment required based on the
assumptions discussed in Part 2, draw your proposed model structure.

**Instructions:**
<!-- todo: get rid of the electronic upload of a diagram bits -->
1.  You can draw a diagram electronically in a program such as
    PowerPoint, or you can draw your diagram by hand and take a photo

2.  Make sure you label all compartments as well as the inflows and
    outflows from each compartment.

3.  Save your diagram in one of the following formats: .jpg, .gif, .png

4.  Upload your diagram using the Browse... button below

5.  If you prefer, you can describe your model in words in the space
    below

**NB: You can replace a file by clicking on the file name and selecting
a file with a different name.**

compartment.**

### Basic reproduction number

The basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, for a vector-borne disease is the
number of secondary infections of the same type (i.e. vector or human)
generated by a single infectious vector or human in a totally
susceptible population. Let's start with a single infectious mosquito.

We firstly start with the expected number of humans (in a totally
susceptible population) infected by this mosquito over the duration of
their infectious period.

**3.4 Write down this expression using the information you have
developed in Parts 2 and 3 (i.e. number of new infections and the
duration of the infectious period). We will denote this as $\mathcal{R}_{HM}$.**

```{=html}
<textarea cols="127" rows="4"></textarea>
```

## Focus questions
What do you notice about the average infectious period of the mosquito? Why is it that? <br>
What do you notice about the units of $\mathcal{R}_{HM}$?
:::

<p><br></p>

Next we consider the expected number of mosquitoes (in a totally
susceptible population) infected by a single human over the duration of
their infectious period.

**3.5 Write down this expression using the information you have
developed in Parts 2 and 3 (i.e. number of new infections and the
duration of the infectious period). We will denote this as $\mathcal{R}_{MH}$.**

```{=html}
<textarea cols="127" rows="4"></textarea>
```

<p><br></p>

Since a single mosquito infects $\mathcal{R}_{HM}$ humans, and each of these
humans infects $\mathcal{R}_{MH}$ mosquitoes, the number of secondary infections a
mosquito generates in mosquitoes is the product of $\mathcal{R}_{HM}$ and
$\mathcal{R}_{MH}$.

**3.6 Write down this expression, cancelling terms where possible to
simplify the expression.**

### Alternatively, describe your model structure here

[SIR for humans, SI for mosquitoes. Force of infection on humans from
mosquitoes and Force of infection on mosquitoes from
humans.]{style="color: blue"}

### Model equations

**3.1 For your model, write in words the inflows and outflows from each
compartment.**

[Change in $S_H=-$ new infections in humans]{style="color: blue"}<br>
[Change in $I_H=$ new infections in humans $-$ recoveries in
humans]{style="color: blue"}<br> 
[Change in $R_H=$ recoveries in humans]{style="color: blue"}<br> [Change in $S_M=-$ new infections in mosquitoes + mosquitoes born $-$ susceptible mosquitoes
died]{style="color: blue"}<br> 
[Change in $I_M=$ new infections in mosquitoes $-$ infectious mosquitoes died]{style="color: blue"}<br>

**3.2 Convert your description of the model inflows and outflows into
the differential equations for your model.**

[$\frac{dS_H}{dt} = - T_{HM} \times \frac{b}{N_H} \times I_M \times S_H$]{style="color: blue"}<br>

[$\frac{dI_M}{dt} =   T_{MH} \times \frac{b}{N_H} \times I_H \times S_M - \mu I_M$]{style="color: blue"}<br>

[where $\mu$ is mosquito birth and death rate]{style="color: blue"}

:::{.callout-note}
This is a very simplified model of the process.
:::
<!-- todo: change "mosquito birth rate" throughout to better reflect that this is really the maturation rate into adult females. Or at least discuss. Add a model diagram from a real paper at the end to discuss the differences. -->

<p><br></p>

**3.3 Write the equations for the size of each population in your
model.**

[$N_H = S_H + I_H + R_H$]{style="color: blue"}<br>
[$N_M = S_M + I_M$]{style="color: blue"}

<!-- this is a good place to discuss sense checking the equations by adding them to note no change in the human or mosquito population sizes -->

<p><br></p>

### Basic reproduction number

The basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, for a vector-borne disease is the
number of secondary infections of the same type (i.e. vector or human)
generated by a single infectious vector or human in a totally
susceptible population. Let's start with a single infectious mosquito.

We firstly start with the expected number of humans (in a totally
susceptible population) infected by this mosquito over the duration of
their infectious period.

<!-- todo: for all these solutions, possibly first write it out in words so can see the direct translation to the equations. -->

**3.4 Write down this expression using the information you have
developed in Parts 2 and 3 (i.e. number of new infections and the
duration of the infectious period). We will denote this as $\mathcal{R}_{HM}$.**

[$I_M=1, \frac{S_H}{N_H}\approx 1$]{style="color: blue"}<br>
[number of new human infections = $T_{HM} \times \frac{b}{N_H} \times I_M \times S_H$]{style="color: blue"}<br>
[duration of the mosquito infectious period = $\frac{1}{\mu}$]{style="color: blue"}<br>
[$\mathcal{R}_{HM} = T_{HM} \times \frac{b}{N_H} \times I_M \times S_H \times \frac{1}{\mu}$]{style="color: blue"}<br>
[$\mathcal{R}_{HM} = T_{HM} \times b \times I_M \times \frac{S_H}{N_H} \times \frac{1}{\mu}$]{style="color: blue"}<br>
[$\mathcal{R}_{HM} = T_{HM} \times b \times 1 \times 1 \times \frac{1}{\mu}$]{style="color: blue"}<br>
[$\mathcal{R}_{HM} = b \times T_{HM} \times \frac{1}{\mu}$]{style="color: blue"}

Next we consider the expected number of mosquitoes (in a totally
susceptible population) infected by a single human over the duration of
their infectious period.

**3.5 Write down this expression using the information you have
developed in Parts 2 and 3 (i.e. number of new infections and the
duration of the infectious period). We will denote this as $\mathcal{R}_{MH}$.**

[$I_H=1, S_M\approx N_M$]{style="color: blue"}<br>
[number of new mosquito infections = $T_{MH} \times \frac{b}{N_H} \times I_H \times S_M$]{style="color: blue"}<br>
[average human infectious period = $\frac{1}{\gamma}$]{style="color: blue"}<br>
[$\mathcal{R}_{MH} = T_{MH} \times \frac{b}{N_H} \times I_H \times S_M \times \frac{1}{\gamma}$]{style="color: blue"}<br>
[$\mathcal{R}_{MH} = T_{MH} \times \frac{b}{N_H} \times 1 \times N_M \times \frac{1}{\gamma}$]{style="color: blue"}<br>
[$\mathcal{R}_{MH} = b \times T_{MH} \times \frac{N_M}{N_H} \times \frac{1}{\gamma}$]{style="color: blue"}

<p><br></p>

Since a single mosquito infects $\mathcal{R}_{HM}$ humans, and each of these
humans infects $\mathcal{R}_{MH}$ mosquitoes, the number of secondary infections a
mosquito generates in mosquitoes is the product of $\mathcal{R}_{HM}$ and
$\mathcal{R}_{MH}$.

**3.6 Write down this expression, cancelling terms where possible to

<p><br></p>

**3.7 What happens to $\mathcal{R}_0$ as the number of mosquitoes increases?
Why?**

[$\mathcal{R}_{MH} \times \mathcal{R}_{HM}$ is $\mathcal{R}_0$ for vector borne
models]{style="color: blue"}<br> 
[$\mathcal{R}_0$ increases as $N_M$ increases, because as the susceptible mosquito population is larger, the infectious human will be bitten by more mosquitoes and pass infection to them]{style="color: blue"}

<p><br></p>

**3.8 What happens to $\mathcal{R}_0$ as the number of humans increases? Why?**

[$\mathcal{R}_0$ decreases, because the fixed number of bites from a mosquito are
now spread over a larger population, so each human is bitten less,
limiting their ability to pass infection on.]{style="color: blue"}

<p><br></p>

**3.9 Depending on the season, mosquitoes may have a reduced life
expectancy. What happens to $\mathcal{R}_0$ as the life expectancy of mosquitoes
reduces? Why?**

[$\mathcal{R}_0$ decreases because mosquitoes have a shorter amount of time over
which they are able to bite humans.]{style="color: blue"}
