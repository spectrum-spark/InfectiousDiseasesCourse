<p>This is an interactive session to introduce the concepts of modelling vector-borne diseases. The motivation for modelling and differences compared to modelling diseases spread by direct transmission will be covered. We will write down a basic model and derive the expression for <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>This session is divided into three parts:</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivation for vector-borne disease models</li>
<li>Examples of vector-borne diseases</li>
<li>Different transmission cycles</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong> covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mechanics of vector-borne disease transmission</li>
<li>Force of infection for vector-borne diseases</li>
<li>Other vector-borne disease modelling considerations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part 3</strong> covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drawing a model schematic</li>
<li>Writing the differential equations</li>
<li>Calculating the basic reproduction number</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike diseases that spread directly from person to person, vector-borne diseases are those diseases in which the spread of an infectious pathogen occurs via a vector — a living organism such as a mosquito. Examples of vectors include (left to right) mosquitoes, ticks, blackflies and fleas:</p>

<p>There are many different types of vector. While some diseases, such as malaria, are exclusively spread by a single vector genus, others, such as lymphatic filariasis, can be transmitted by multiple species. Similarly, some vectors are able to spread multiple diseases.</p>

<p>We can divide vector-borne diseases into two categories, those that spread by a human-vector-human cycle (e.g.&nbsp;malaria, dengue, zika, onchocerciasis) and those that involve a non-human host (e.g.&nbsp;West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis). In this session, we will only be working with diseases that spread by a human-vector-human cycle.</p>

<section id="burden-of-disease" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="burden-of-disease">Burden of disease</h3>
<p>Diseases spread by vectors account for almost one-fifth of all infectious diseases and are responsible for more than 700,000 deaths annually. Much of this disease burden is due to malaria and dengue infections, estimated to cause more than 440,000 deaths per year. The map below displays the distribution of deaths due to vector-borne diseases, estimated by the World Health Organization in 2002. While Africa has the highest burden, there is substantial burden in the Asia Pacific region. As global temperatures increase, the global distribution of vectors is changing, which may allow the spread of vector-borne diseases into new areas.</p>

<p>We can divide vector-borne diseases into two categories, those that spread by a human-vector-human cycle (e.g.&nbsp;malaria, dengue, zika, onchocerciasis) and those that involve a non-human host (e.g.&nbsp;West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis). In this session, we will only be working with diseases that spread by a human-vector-human cycle.</p>

<section id="burden-of-disease-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="burden-of-disease-1">Burden of disease</h3>
<p>Diseases spread by vectors account for almost one-fifth of all infectious diseases and are responsible for more than 700,000 deaths annually. Much of this disease burden is due to malaria and dengue infections, estimated to cause more than 440,000 deaths per year. The map below displays the distribution of deaths due to vector-borne diseases, estimated by the World Health Organization in 2002. While Africa has the highest burden, there is substantial burden in the Asia Pacific region. As global temperatures increase, the global distribution of vectors is changing, which may allow the spread of vector-borne diseases into new areas.</p>

<p>While there are many different types of vectors, in this and the following part we will cover modelling of diseases that are spread by mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes bite humans to obtain protein from blood for their developing eggs. These bites can transmit infection from mosquito to human or from human to mosquito. The following diagram outlines a simple transmission cycle of a mosquito-borne disease:</p>

<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>The steps involved in transmission, as indicated on the diagram above are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A susceptible mosquito bites an infectious human.</li>
<li>Infection is successfully transmitted to the mosquito. The pathogen multiplies within the mosquito. The mosquito is now infectious, and capable of transmitting disease.</li>
<li>The infectious mosquito bites a susceptible human.</li>
<li>Infection is successfully transmitted to the human. The pathogen multiplies within the human. The human is now infectious, and capable of transmitting disease.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might notice that in our diagram above both humans and mosquitoes are infectious immediately upon being infected. In reality, it takes time for the infectious load to build in a host before they are capable of transmitting infection. We make this assumption here to simplify the explanation of the transmission process.</p>

<p>The feature that makes vector-borne disease models different to models for diseases spread by direct contact is that the human and mosquito populations interact through bites. We start with the assumption that each mosquito makes a fixed number of bites per unit time, and we define this as <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. We further assume that those bites are uniformly spread across the human population, <span class="math inline">\(N_H\)</span>.

<p><span class="math display">\[r=\frac{b}{N_H}\]</span></p>
<p>This is the number of bites a single human receives from a single mosquito per unit time, and is analogous to ‘contact’ in directly-transmitted disease models.</p>

<p>Similar to contacts in the case of directly transmitted (human to human) infections, not all mosquito bites will be of sufficient intensity to transmit infection.

<p>Now that we have explored how the human and mosquito populations interact in a vector-borne disease model and made some assumptions around what to include in our first model, we will design an appropriate model structure. Using the model compartments you identified in Part 2, and the inflows and outflows from each compartment required based on the assumptions discussed in Part 2, draw your proposed model structure.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You can draw a diagram electronically in a program such as PowerPoint, or you can draw your diagram by hand and take a photo</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you label all compartments as well as the inflows and outflows from each compartment.</p></li>
<li><p>Save your diagram in one of the following formats: .jpg, .gif, .png</p></li>
<li><p>Upload your diagram using the Browse… button below</p></li>
<li><p>If you prefer, you can describe your model in words in the space below</p></li>
